1
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:05,486
"You are about to meet
a strange people

2
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:08,456
"in a strange enemy country.

3
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:10,893
"You must keep clear
of the Germans.

4
00:01:10,895 --> 00:01:12,063
"You must not...

5
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,031
"... fraternize. "

6
00:01:17,033 --> 00:01:18,367
What does that mean?

7
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,438
It means we shouldn't be
friendly to them.

8
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,790
This house is requisitioned
for British use

9
00:02:15,792 --> 00:02:17,961
by order of
the Control Commission, Germany.

10
00:02:21,664 --> 00:02:23,533
<i>You'll forgive us, Fraulein.</i>

11
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:26,902
It belongs
to a family Lubert.

12
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:28,972
He's an architect, sir.

13
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,488
All change.

14
00:03:01,906 --> 00:03:03,338
He's meeting you here, is he?

15
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,876
Susan.

16
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:08,243
- How was your trip?
- Long.

17
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:09,177
Quick, let's get home.

18
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:20,657
Rachael.

19
00:03:21,825 --> 00:03:23,090
Hello, Lewis.

20
00:03:23,092 --> 00:03:24,095
My God. Look at you.

21
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:26,531
It's freezing.

22
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,432
It is.

23
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:30,668
Here.

24
00:03:31,636 --> 00:03:33,704
Let me take this.

25
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:47,416
Welcome. Please come inside.

26
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:49,718
Let me show you the house.

27
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,789
Please, come inside.
Let me show you the house.

28
00:04:24,554 --> 00:04:26,090
They're still finding bodies.

29
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:30,494
There's over 25,000 dead
still unaccounted for.

30
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:35,230
How are you?

31
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:37,801
Good. Fine. You?

32
00:04:39,402 --> 00:04:41,035
It's...

33
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:42,138
It's been difficult.

34
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,675
For you, too, I expect.

35
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,576
For all of us.

36
00:04:48,145 --> 00:04:50,612
We dropped more bombs
on Hamburg in one weekend

37
00:04:50,614 --> 00:04:52,717
than fell on London
in the whole of the war.

38
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:57,220
That's different.

39
00:05:00,056 --> 00:05:01,592
Yeah.

40
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:42,667
Thank you, Barker.

41
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:46,669
Colonel Morgan.

42
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:48,737
<i>- Welcome.
- Herr Lubert.</i>

43
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:51,306
Please come inside.
Let me show you the house.

44
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:53,077
This is my wife, Mrs. Morgan.

45
00:05:54,277 --> 00:05:55,646
How do you do?

46
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:59,984
- After you, Mrs. Morgan.
- Thank you.

47
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:09,693
The finest room of the house.

48
00:06:10,527 --> 00:06:12,063
It's lovely,
isn't it, darling?

49
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,265
It's very modern.

50
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:17,367
Yes, it is.

51
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,771
That's a Steinway.

52
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:26,009
- An excellent instrument.
- Yes.

53
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:27,943
Do you play?

54
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:29,778
Actually,
I've rather let it slip.

55
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,183
Well, it will be good
to have it played again.

56
00:06:33,984 --> 00:06:35,753
What was up there before?

57
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:39,955
A painting.
It was damaged.

58
00:06:39,957 --> 00:06:41,392
I haven't replaced it yet.

59
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:45,196
So the main staircase is
this way.

60
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:53,535
Our library.

61
00:06:53,537 --> 00:06:55,136
Herr Lubert's an architect.

62
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:56,405
Was.

63
00:06:56,407 --> 00:06:58,309
Now I'm a metal press operator.

64
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:01,812
Shall we?

65
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:07,848
<i>Die Elbe.</i>

66
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,085
It flows all the way
to the, uh...

67
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:11,752
I'm sorry,
I don't have the English.

68
00:07:11,754 --> 00:07:13,121
<i>The Deutsche See?</i>

69
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:15,622
- North Sea.
- The North Sea, yes.

70
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:17,261
It's all the same sea
in the end.

71
00:07:18,227 --> 00:07:19,263
Indeed.

72
00:07:20,597 --> 00:07:22,233
It's cold.
Can we go in?

73
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:32,743
I hope you can be
as happy here as we were.

74
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:35,876
My daughter and I
will stay out of your way

75
00:07:35,878 --> 00:07:37,748
until we move to the camp.

76
00:07:39,549 --> 00:07:40,885
Thank you.

77
00:07:57,534 --> 00:08:00,271
You should
have told me, that's all.

78
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:22,760
What?

79
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:26,897
Thinking of our honeymoon.

80
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,909
My God.

81
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:43,180
You look beautiful.

82
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:48,451
You've still got this.

83
00:08:49,753 --> 00:08:50,988
Of course.

84
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:08,104
You're smoking?

85
00:09:11,542 --> 00:09:15,144
Dr. Mayfield said that it
would help with my nerves.

86
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:16,280
And has it?

87
00:09:42,638 --> 00:09:44,508
The cabin, you remember?

88
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:47,311
With its leaky roof.

89
00:09:51,915 --> 00:09:54,351
- It rained for two weeks.
- It did.

90
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:58,752
And, my God, that cold.

91
00:09:58,754 --> 00:10:00,121
You burnt my books.

92
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:01,756
Well, I had to.
I had no choice.

93
00:10:01,758 --> 00:10:03,224
It was Agatha Christie.

94
00:10:03,226 --> 00:10:05,361
You might have waited
until I found out who did it.

95
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,663
- The butler.
- The butler always did it.

96
00:10:08,665 --> 00:10:10,067
Mm-hmm.

97
00:10:12,603 --> 00:10:14,071
Happy times.

98
00:10:43,066 --> 00:10:45,002
Good.
The governor's here.

99
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,169
Wilkins.

100
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:49,371
Sir.

101
00:10:49,373 --> 00:10:51,472
They were hit delivering
food to the camp, sir.

102
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:52,808
A grenade, I believe.

103
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:53,940
Two of ours dead.

104
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:55,910
Bloody looters
are making it worse.

105
00:10:55,912 --> 00:10:57,645
Back!
Get them back!

106
00:10:57,647 --> 00:10:59,514
- Push them back!
- Come on, move.

107
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:01,382
Get them off!

108
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:02,183
Christ.

109
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:03,984
The breath on these people.

110
00:11:03,986 --> 00:11:04,987
Yes, well, that's what

111
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:07,054
900 calories a day
does to you.

112
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:08,625
Well, at least they're less
trouble when they're hungry.

113
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:13,063
Keith Burnham,
Divisional Intelligence.

114
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:16,667
So what have we got?

115
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,833
- Is that him?
- That's the fella.

116
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:23,905
Looks like Werwolves. 88s.

117
00:11:23,907 --> 00:11:25,841
Nazi bastards
who won't accept we've won.

118
00:11:25,843 --> 00:11:27,876
Captain, can we have
these two boys taken care of?

119
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:29,444
Absolutely.

120
00:11:34,984 --> 00:11:36,785
A medic!
Wilkins, get a medic.

121
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:38,088
Yes, sir!

122
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,932
Thought so. 88.

123
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,338
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

124
00:11:55,604 --> 00:11:58,374
Private.
Get our men on the truck.

125
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,311
And somebody bag this one up.

126
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:03,072
Oh. Hello.

127
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,542
You must be Freda.

128
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,313
What were you reading?

129
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:17,687
Freda.

130
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,130
She never listens.

131
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:31,035
I'm only her father.

132
00:14:08,071 --> 00:14:09,572
I'm sorry, I... I don't...

133
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:40,436
Sorry, emergency.

134
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:46,841
Ooh, I see you have coffee.

135
00:14:46,843 --> 00:14:47,942
Yeah, I'd... I'd prefer tea.

136
00:14:47,944 --> 00:14:49,678
They don't really do tea.

137
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,978
I'll rustle some up
from the NAAFI.

138
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,216
- Coffee it is, then.
- No.

139
00:14:54,218 --> 00:14:55,619
Sleep well?

140
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:57,753
Actually, I did.

141
00:14:58,653 --> 00:14:59,789
Good.

142
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:02,655
That's really good.

143
00:15:02,657 --> 00:15:05,229
I'm looking forward
to it being just us.

144
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,163
What?

145
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:10,400
Uh...

146
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,342
What if we let them
stay on?

147
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:21,275
The staff? Do we need them?

148
00:15:21,277 --> 00:15:22,613
The Luberts.

149
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:26,180
So you mean...
Live with them?

150
00:15:26,182 --> 00:15:28,549
I mean, they'd be
on the top floor.

151
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:30,320
Rach, we'd hardly notice
they're here.

152
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:33,588
- Is everyone doing it?
- Here.

153
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,658
It's not the same. No one else
has a house like this.

154
00:15:36,859 --> 00:15:38,193
This isn't what we wanted.

155
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:42,163
The big house, the staff,
the art on the walls.

156
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:43,800
I know.

157
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:46,266
I thought we were going
to be together.

158
00:15:46,268 --> 00:15:47,568
We are together.

159
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,672
Alone.

160
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,875
I...

161
00:15:54,877 --> 00:15:56,513
I'm not comfortable with it.

162
00:15:58,681 --> 00:16:00,948
With them.
Not comfortable with them

163
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,951
because they're Germans.

164
00:16:08,557 --> 00:16:10,359
It's chaos out there, Rachael.

165
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:12,926
There's nowhere to put
these people.

166
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:13,995
There's nowhere to...

167
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:15,195
Nothing to feed these people.

168
00:16:15,197 --> 00:16:16,896
There's...

169
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:21,301
It does... It makes no sense
to throw the Luberts out.

170
00:16:21,303 --> 00:16:23,706
You didn't tell me
what I was walking into.

171
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:26,507
This isn't how
it was supposed to be.

172
00:16:26,509 --> 00:16:28,742
None of this is how
it is supposed to be.

173
00:16:28,744 --> 00:16:29,845
And yet here we are.

174
00:16:42,325 --> 00:16:43,560
Thank you.

175
00:16:44,527 --> 00:16:46,562
- I'm very grateful.
- You're very welcome.

176
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:48,632
Thank you.

177
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:14,321
Sorry. Uh...
Could, um...

178
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:16,290
Could one of you
help me, please?

179
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:17,461
I want to move the plants.

180
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,764
The plants?

181
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,600
They're blocking the light.

182
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,489
You don't like the chair?

183
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,663
It's a Mies van der Rohe.

184
00:18:28,097 --> 00:18:29,998
"The house
of construction. "

185
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,032
It's meant to be one of
the most comfortable chairs

186
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,201
ever invented.

187
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:35,168
Well, it isn't.

188
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,340
It's ugly.

189
00:18:37,506 --> 00:18:39,740
He was of the Bauhaus school.

190
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:41,642
Their philosophy was
all about rejecting

191
00:18:41,644 --> 00:18:42,777
unnecessary adornment.

192
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,378
Do you really need
a philosophy

193
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,881
to make something
comfortable?

194
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:50,184
Well, behind every object,
there is a philosophy,

195
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:51,919
isn't there?

196
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:54,890
<i>Herr Lubert, please don't
creep about the house.</i>

197
00:18:56,158 --> 00:18:58,628
I thought we agreed
to keep to our own quarters.

198
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:01,864
Our "zones. "
Yes, of course.

199
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,197
I will try to remember.

200
00:19:04,199 --> 00:19:07,402
And if your daughter
wants anything from her room,

201
00:19:07,404 --> 00:19:08,839
I'll get Heike
to bring it up to her.

202
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:11,505
This is all very new to her.

203
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:12,775
All the same.

204
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:17,779
- I will make words with her.
- Have words.

205
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,547
- Sorry?
- In English, you don't

206
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,752
"make" words with someone.

207
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:28,356
You should have these.

208
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:30,659
As the lady of the house.

209
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:54,618
<i>Delicious, Heike.
Danke schon, really.</i>

210
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:04,895
<i>Danke, Frau Morgan.</i>

211
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:13,466
Look, she's doing it again.
She's smirking.

212
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:16,138
Because you said
she was delicious.

213
00:20:19,908 --> 00:20:22,579
- I was making an effort.
- I know.

214
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:29,619
I don't know
how you do it.

215
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:31,921
What?

216
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:37,124
You go on like before,
all your little rituals.

217
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:38,795
Get up, shave.

218
00:20:40,362 --> 00:20:42,599
Have a meal, go to work.

219
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,968
- Like nothing had changed.
- Please, Rachael.

220
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:49,739
I don't think it's healthy
to talk this way.

221
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:52,007
- No?
- No.

222
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:54,975
Oh.

223
00:20:54,977 --> 00:20:57,278
No? How... How am I expected
to talk?

224
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,049
You might like
to set an example.

225
00:21:04,786 --> 00:21:07,223
When did you get to be
so self-righteous?

226
00:22:40,949 --> 00:22:43,319
Come on.
Let's have that tea.

227
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,621
I don't know when he got
to be so sanctimonious.

228
00:22:47,623 --> 00:22:50,059
You stifle under the weight
of all that decency.

229
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,964
Lawrence of Hamburg,
Keith calls him.

230
00:22:54,964 --> 00:22:57,731
The one who went queer
for the natives.

231
00:22:57,733 --> 00:22:59,633
He actually seems
to like Lubert.

232
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:01,204
Lew let them stay on.

233
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,941
Is that wise?

234
00:23:05,908 --> 00:23:07,841
There may not be
an outward show of hatred,

235
00:23:07,843 --> 00:23:09,778
but it's there
below the surface.

236
00:23:10,745 --> 00:23:13,015
Be careful, that's all.
They're not like us.

237
00:23:24,593 --> 00:23:26,228
Good afternoon.

238
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:03,431
Freda.

239
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:15,108
It's fine.

240
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,710
Please forgive her,
Mrs. Morgan.

241
00:24:16,712 --> 00:24:18,378
She should have asked
permission.

242
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,848
- It's all right.
- It's not.

243
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,683
- She plays well.
- She plays very badly.

244
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:23,951
She never practices.

245
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:25,618
Claudia despaired of her.

246
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:26,889
Claudia?

247
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:29,024
Her mother.

248
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:31,191
My wife.

249
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:32,091
Oh.

250
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:34,129
Is she somewhere
in the house too?

251
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:37,200
She died in the firestorm.

252
00:24:42,138 --> 00:24:43,706
I'm so sorry.

253
00:24:47,976 --> 00:24:49,041
Um...

254
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:52,780
If Freda wants to play,
I don't see why not.

255
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,313
In the afternoons,
for half an hour or so, I...

256
00:24:54,315 --> 00:24:56,852
I thought we agreed
to keep to our "zones. "

257
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,913
You'll be paid
in food vouchers

258
00:26:32,915 --> 00:26:34,248
- for your work, given a meal...
- Freda.

259
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,782
...and brought
back home before dark.

260
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:37,550
Are you 16?

261
00:27:29,871 --> 00:27:31,407
Bodies!

262
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,376
Bodies here!

263
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:39,413
All right, stand back.

264
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:40,848
Get them away
from it, Tom, will you?

265
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,148
Not a bad way to go...

266
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,916
One last screw
before lights out.

267
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:47,052
- Come.
- Back to work, you lot.

268
00:27:48,357 --> 00:27:50,026
Bag up these bones.

269
00:28:32,134 --> 00:28:34,201
Forgive me for intruding.

270
00:28:34,203 --> 00:28:36,803
It's freezing upstairs.
I cut some firewood earlier.

271
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:38,539
- Do you mind if I...
- No, not at all.

272
00:28:38,541 --> 00:28:39,943
No need to ask permission.

273
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:42,675
We're going out this evening,

274
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:43,612
but can I get you a drink?

275
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:45,982
No, thank you.

276
00:28:48,783 --> 00:28:52,051
Well then. Good night.

277
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:53,255
Good night.

278
00:29:10,973 --> 00:29:13,276
- Still got it.
- Keith won't be long.

279
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,211
- We're so glad you could come.
- Thank you.

280
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:19,146
Well, it's good
to finally meet you

281
00:29:19,148 --> 00:29:22,048
and a relief to be
out of the house.

282
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,884
What a house, though.

283
00:29:23,886 --> 00:29:25,455
It's almost worth
living with a German.

284
00:29:27,455 --> 00:29:28,454
It's so funny.

285
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:30,824
You've got one, too.
A missing painting.

286
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:32,459
We have one just like it.

287
00:29:32,461 --> 00:29:33,460
Everyone does.

288
00:29:33,462 --> 00:29:35,361
It's where
they would have hung him.

289
00:29:35,363 --> 00:29:36,530
Who?

290
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:38,199
<i>The Fuhrer.</i>

291
00:29:38,201 --> 00:29:39,566
"The stain
that can't be removed. "

292
00:29:39,568 --> 00:29:42,235
They're usually clever enough
to cover them up.

293
00:29:42,237 --> 00:29:43,270
Hmm.

294
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:45,308
Sorry to keep you. Apologies.

295
00:29:46,774 --> 00:29:48,308
Thank you.

296
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,176
Based on their answers,
we assign them a category

297
00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:51,645
from black to white.

298
00:29:51,647 --> 00:29:52,913
They're clean,

299
00:29:52,915 --> 00:29:54,947
<i>they get their Persilschein,</i>

300
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:56,983
their laundry ticket.

301
00:29:56,985 --> 00:29:58,452
It's the certificate

302
00:29:58,454 --> 00:30:00,354
allowing them to return
to a normal life.

303
00:30:00,356 --> 00:30:03,424
<i>Does Lubert have
his Persilschein?</i>

304
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:04,527
Does it matter?

305
00:30:05,426 --> 00:30:06,192
Yes.

306
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:07,860
I think I have the right

307
00:30:07,862 --> 00:30:09,194
to know if I'm living
with a Nazi.

308
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:10,431
Yes, I think it does matter.

309
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,998
I don't think
you can judge a person

310
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,267
by his answers
to a questionnaire.

311
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:16,569
No? How do you judge him?

312
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:18,073
You look him in the eye.

313
00:30:19,475 --> 00:30:21,942
- Lubert was never in uniform.
- That's not the point.

314
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:23,475
Well, there was no blood
on his hands.

315
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:25,311
There's blood
on all their hands.

316
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:28,115
Honestly, Lew,
I sometimes wonder whose side you're on.

317
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:30,183
Even after everything
that they've done...

318
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:31,686
The war is over.
We won.

319
00:30:33,054 --> 00:30:34,456
That's the end of it.

320
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,930
Let's have dessert
in the drawing room.

321
00:30:43,932 --> 00:30:45,668
Well, does he or not?

322
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:48,569
Not yet.

323
00:30:48,571 --> 00:30:49,738
It's a formality.

324
00:30:50,973 --> 00:30:52,175
Shall we?

325
00:31:01,382 --> 00:31:02,751
Morning, sir.

326
00:31:09,858 --> 00:31:11,293
Papers, ma'am.

327
00:31:13,994 --> 00:31:15,330
Papers.

328
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:17,831
There you are.

329
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:19,134
Papers, sir.

330
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:36,511
So you were building houses
for Nazi officials.

331
00:32:37,846 --> 00:32:41,284
After 1933, we built
what we were told to build.

332
00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:49,188
Did the bombing affect

333
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,193
the health of you
and your family?

334
00:32:53,395 --> 00:32:55,464
It's a simple question.

335
00:32:57,331 --> 00:32:59,401
It affected the health
of my wife.

336
00:33:01,235 --> 00:33:02,836
She was one
of the 40,000 killed

337
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:05,273
when British bombers
razed this city to the ground.

338
00:33:07,208 --> 00:33:10,076
July 27th, 1943.

339
00:33:10,078 --> 00:33:11,881
Well, let's talk
about your wife.

340
00:33:13,048 --> 00:33:14,180
The money was hers?

341
00:33:14,182 --> 00:33:16,649
Her family was wealthy, yes.

342
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:18,418
They owned a number
of shipping yards.

343
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:21,922
Shipping yards used
to transfer Nazi weapons?

344
00:33:21,924 --> 00:33:23,522
Among many other things.

345
00:33:23,524 --> 00:33:25,325
You have to understand
that my wife and I

346
00:33:25,327 --> 00:33:27,527
had nothing to do
with her family business.

347
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:31,463
Yet you claim to never
have joined the Nazi Party?

348
00:33:31,465 --> 00:33:35,003
I was against everything
the Nazis stood for.

349
00:33:36,538 --> 00:33:38,241
That wasn't my question.

350
00:33:40,975 --> 00:33:41,977
No.

351
00:33:42,977 --> 00:33:44,613
I was never a party member.

352
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:57,459
Did you know
about the camps?

353
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,395
No.

354
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:03,796
So you've never seen these?

355
00:34:03,798 --> 00:34:05,034
Here.

356
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:08,370
Have a look.

357
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:20,813
One last question.

358
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:23,583
During the war, did you ever
hope for a German victory?

359
00:34:23,585 --> 00:34:26,418
You answered,
"I wanted it to end. "

360
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:28,288
I wanted to go back
to how it was.

361
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:31,060
What, you miss the past?
Is that it?

362
00:34:33,395 --> 00:34:34,830
I miss my wife.

363
00:34:40,134 --> 00:34:41,467
All right.

364
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:43,438
You'll hear from us
in due course.

365
00:35:01,489 --> 00:35:02,792
<i>Herr Lubert?</i>

366
00:35:05,393 --> 00:35:07,293
<i>Herr Lubert?</i>

367
00:35:07,295 --> 00:35:08,663
Could you come
in here, please?

368
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:17,773
Could you explain this?

369
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,411
It's a von Guerard.

370
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,512
I'm not asking what it is.

371
00:35:25,514 --> 00:35:26,980
I'm asking
what it's doing here.

372
00:35:26,982 --> 00:35:30,217
You objected to the stain,
so I covered it.

373
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:31,617
What's the matter,
don't you like it?

374
00:35:31,619 --> 00:35:33,485
That's not the point.
What's it covering?

375
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:34,887
Does it offend you?

376
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:36,690
He was German,
maybe that offends you.

377
00:35:36,692 --> 00:35:38,828
It was a picture of him,
wasn't it?

378
00:35:39,594 --> 00:35:41,831
<i>- Of him?
- Your Fuhrer.</i>

379
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:47,069
It's simple for you.

380
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:49,335
The war ends.

381
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:50,906
You go home the winner.

382
00:35:51,739 --> 00:35:54,507
- Your conscience is clear.
- Oh.

383
00:35:54,509 --> 00:35:56,708
Is your conscience
not clear?

384
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,779
I thought you would like
the painting.

385
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,380
I apologize if I was mistaken.

386
00:36:01,382 --> 00:36:03,085
Would you object
to a landscape?

387
00:36:04,219 --> 00:36:05,719
A nice hunting scene perhaps?

388
00:36:05,721 --> 00:36:08,255
- I object to your tone.
- Then throw us out!

389
00:36:08,257 --> 00:36:10,056
<i>- Herr Lubert.
- Throw us out.</i>

390
00:36:10,058 --> 00:36:11,659
You hate us.

391
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:14,059
It's what you want.

392
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:15,862
- Throw us out.
- Nobody said anything about...

393
00:36:15,864 --> 00:36:17,663
We can leave you alone
to fight with your husband,

394
00:36:17,665 --> 00:36:19,435
when he bothers to be here.

395
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:25,137
I think you've said enough.

396
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:26,542
Then throw us out.

397
00:36:27,308 --> 00:36:29,011
Here. I'll give you a reason.

398
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,522
I think you should go.

399
00:40:18,172 --> 00:40:19,273
What do you think?

400
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:24,710
- It's stunning.
- Idiot.

401
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:26,681
- Me?
- I meant the table.

402
00:40:27,815 --> 00:40:32,087
Burnham at the head
or next to Susan?

403
00:40:34,089 --> 00:40:36,755
Let's just keep him
away from the alcohol.

404
00:40:36,757 --> 00:40:38,724
Just don't argue with him.

405
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:40,592
- Mm-hmm.
- Be English.

406
00:40:40,594 --> 00:40:42,397
Talk about the weather.

407
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,864
What are you doing?

408
00:40:44,866 --> 00:40:48,067
I was just admiring
your dress.

409
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:49,902
Oh.

410
00:40:49,904 --> 00:40:52,137
Thinking how lucky I am.

411
00:40:52,139 --> 00:40:53,773
Do you like it?

412
00:40:53,775 --> 00:40:55,911
You ought to,
it took me long enough.

413
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:58,980
I'm imagining...

414
00:41:00,614 --> 00:41:02,317
what you look like out of it.

415
00:41:09,523 --> 00:41:11,590
When do our guests arrive?

416
00:41:11,592 --> 00:41:12,958
Not for an hour.

417
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,161
- Not for an hour.
- Uh-uh.

418
00:41:15,163 --> 00:41:16,462
Hmm.

419
00:41:16,464 --> 00:41:18,396
You are...

420
00:41:26,741 --> 00:41:28,243
Go upstairs.

421
00:41:41,188 --> 00:41:42,491
Lock the door.

422
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,525
What is it?

423
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:48,964
There's a protest
at headquarters.

424
00:41:50,831 --> 00:41:52,632
I'm sorry, my love, but...

425
00:41:52,634 --> 00:41:56,438
Well, you'll have to entertain
the guests until I get back.

426
00:42:05,413 --> 00:42:06,813
Go on, then.

427
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,350
Go and save Germany.

428
00:42:10,851 --> 00:42:12,453
Don't be like that.

429
00:42:15,857 --> 00:42:17,893
I'll be back as soon as I can.

430
00:42:21,295 --> 00:42:22,431
Wish me luck.

431
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,975
Feed us! Feed us! Feed us!

432
00:42:35,377 --> 00:42:36,275
Captain.

433
00:42:36,277 --> 00:42:37,777
They've barricaded
the street, sir.

434
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:39,145
They're not letting
anybody in or out.

435
00:42:39,147 --> 00:42:40,579
I want
this street closed off.

436
00:42:40,581 --> 00:42:42,882
Captain, tell the men
there is to be no firing.

437
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,619
Break through!

438
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:48,090
We need more men!

439
00:42:54,663 --> 00:42:56,563
Get back!

440
00:42:57,965 --> 00:43:00,034
Hey! Hey, hey!

441
00:43:05,772 --> 00:43:07,907
Back!

442
00:43:10,478 --> 00:43:13,579
Sir. Sir, where are you going?

443
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:15,050
Get back!

444
00:43:32,567 --> 00:43:35,270
No firing. No firing!

445
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:45,011
- It's outrageous. A clergyman?
- A chance to rebuild.

446
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:46,380
What choice have we got?

447
00:43:48,382 --> 00:43:49,882
Thank you, Heike.

448
00:43:49,884 --> 00:43:52,319
We've done them a favor.
Now it's time to leave.

449
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:55,023
We're talking about war.
Nobody really wins, do they?

450
00:43:55,956 --> 00:43:57,422
There's nothing
left for us here.

451
00:43:57,424 --> 00:43:59,759
French got the wine.
Yanks got the view.

452
00:43:59,761 --> 00:44:00,994
What, we got the ruins?

453
00:44:02,263 --> 00:44:04,333
<i>And what does
Herr Lubert think?</i>

454
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:09,103
I don't know.
You'd have to ask him.

455
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,773
Well, I must say,
this is good hock.

456
00:44:13,775 --> 00:44:15,577
<i>Thank Herr Lubert.</i>

457
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:29,655
<i>d With many cheerful facts d</i>

458
00:44:29,657 --> 00:44:31,960

462
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:46,139
Bravo!

463
00:44:49,576 --> 00:44:50,876
Oh!

464
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:53,112
<i>Herr Lubert! Come and join us.</i>

465
00:44:53,114 --> 00:44:55,951
My husband wants
your opinion on something.

466
00:45:01,556 --> 00:45:03,855
I'm not feeling my best.

467
00:45:03,857 --> 00:45:05,993
But thank you all the same.

468
00:45:08,029 --> 00:45:09,561
Good night.

469
00:45:09,563 --> 00:45:11,197
<i>d If you don't thrill me d</i>

470
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:12,965
<i>d Like you used to thrill me d</i>

471
00:45:12,967 --> 00:45:14,335
<i>d That's sabotage d</i>

472
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:18,603
<i>d If you don't kiss me

473
00:45:18,605 --> 00:45:20,674
<i>d That's sabotage d</i>

474
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,041
I would ask you not to hit
the piano like that.

475
00:45:23,043 --> 00:45:24,210
<i>d When you hear

476
00:45:24,212 --> 00:45:26,045
<i>d Those be-alert alarms d</i>

477
00:45:26,047 --> 00:45:27,179
It belonged to my wife.

478
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:30,282
<i>d Don't run helter-skelter d</i>

479
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:33,619
<i>d There's a bomb-proof shelter

480
00:45:33,621 --> 00:45:34,920
Lubert.

481
00:45:34,922 --> 00:45:36,558
Lubert, Lubert...

482
00:45:37,891 --> 00:45:39,560
Steady on.
All right, all right.

483
00:45:44,398 --> 00:45:45,730
Sorry about the glass,
old boy.

484
00:45:45,732 --> 00:45:47,635
Stefan.

485
00:46:03,851 --> 00:46:05,150
Well done.

486
00:46:05,152 --> 00:46:06,751
I'm so sorry.

487
00:46:06,753 --> 00:46:07,755
What for?

488
00:46:09,223 --> 00:46:11,192
I'm the one
who should apologize.

489
00:46:16,364 --> 00:46:17,598
Good night.

490
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,136
Good night.

491
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,455
That's not necessary.

492
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:43,324
You've got grit in it.

493
00:46:52,232 --> 00:46:54,101
This is going to hurt.

494
00:47:05,346 --> 00:47:07,482
You've been avoiding me.

495
00:47:09,417 --> 00:47:10,518
Have I?

496
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:13,088
I don't think so.

497
00:47:14,688 --> 00:47:16,290
I was going to apologize.

498
00:47:18,025 --> 00:47:19,394
For what?

499
00:47:23,998 --> 00:47:25,400
Don't.

500
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,703
I was going to...

501
00:47:29,938 --> 00:47:31,239
but I won't.

502
00:47:37,043 --> 00:47:38,413
Rachael.

503
00:48:48,715 --> 00:48:49,817
Stop.

504
00:49:08,835 --> 00:49:10,272
Everything all right?

505
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:12,940
Uh...

506
00:49:14,442 --> 00:49:16,409
What happened to you?

507
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,313
I was caught up in a protest.

508
00:49:19,346 --> 00:49:21,045
You were at the protest?

509
00:49:21,047 --> 00:49:23,047
Not by choice.

510
00:49:23,049 --> 00:49:24,983
Then you know what happened.

511
00:49:24,985 --> 00:49:26,353
Bloody people tried
to kill me.

512
00:49:27,654 --> 00:49:29,654
I mean, what is the matter
with this country?

513
00:49:29,656 --> 00:49:31,725
You don't realize
we're here to help?

514
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,962
I should go.

515
00:49:37,165 --> 00:49:39,400
- Good night.
- Good night.

516
00:49:41,034 --> 00:49:43,538
I'm sorry. How was the party?

517
00:49:44,605 --> 00:49:45,807
Fine.

518
00:49:46,975 --> 00:49:48,174
I'm tired.
I'm going to go up.

519
00:49:48,176 --> 00:49:50,411
All right.
I'll be up in a bit.

520
00:50:30,918 --> 00:50:32,817
Ah. Freda.

521
00:50:32,819 --> 00:50:37,822
Listen, do you have
something of mine? Yes?

522
00:50:37,824 --> 00:50:40,291
My wife gave it to me.
There are photographs in there,

523
00:50:40,293 --> 00:50:41,830
and I would like it back.

524
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:44,766
Perhaps you've seen it?

525
00:50:48,435 --> 00:50:49,937
Freda, I...

526
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:37,985
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

527
00:51:39,052 --> 00:51:40,788
- Sir.
- Thank you.

528
00:51:43,723 --> 00:51:44,792
Sir.

529
00:51:47,293 --> 00:51:48,763
There's been an attack.

530
00:51:50,531 --> 00:51:52,264
Bomb, sir.
In the Russian zone.

531
00:51:52,266 --> 00:51:53,768
Oh, Christ.

532
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:56,902
It's only for a few days.

533
00:51:56,904 --> 00:51:58,637
I'll be back in time
for Christmas.

534
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:02,308
Well, where are you going?
I could come with you.

535
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:03,645
I'm sorry, no.

536
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:09,081
"This is the army,
Mrs. Jones. "

537
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:10,183
Yes.

538
00:52:10,185 --> 00:52:13,420
I'll make it up to you,
I promise. Hmm?

539
00:52:17,192 --> 00:52:18,893
I suppose
I should be used to it.

540
00:52:24,397 --> 00:52:25,966
Six days.

541
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:28,803
Sorry?

542
00:52:30,237 --> 00:52:31,473
I asked.

543
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:34,576
I checked.

544
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:39,445
They'd have given you
six days leave

545
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:40,915
after the funeral...

546
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:46,621
and you didn't take it.

547
00:52:51,592 --> 00:52:52,927
Why didn't you take it?

548
00:52:56,563 --> 00:52:57,762
I asked myself that

549
00:52:57,764 --> 00:52:59,331
and I had a lot of time
to think about it.

550
00:52:59,333 --> 00:53:01,168
- Please.
- And then I thought, why...

551
00:53:03,371 --> 00:53:07,273
"Maybe he just doesn't...

552
00:53:07,275 --> 00:53:09,541
- Rach.
- "... feel it like I do. "

553
00:53:14,047 --> 00:53:16,514
- He wasn't there.
- No.

554
00:53:16,516 --> 00:53:18,550
There was a war on.
I had a job to do.

555
00:53:18,552 --> 00:53:19,821
What did I have?

556
00:53:24,991 --> 00:53:26,060
Nothing.

557
00:53:30,764 --> 00:53:32,567
What is it you want from me?

558
00:53:35,402 --> 00:53:36,604
Lewis...

559
00:53:42,076 --> 00:53:43,778
I want him back.

560
00:53:52,585 --> 00:53:54,087
I can't do that for you.

561
00:53:56,089 --> 00:53:58,489
Lewis. Lewis. Please.

562
00:53:58,491 --> 00:54:00,227
I'm asking you.
I'm begging you.

563
00:54:02,563 --> 00:54:04,065
Please don't go.

564
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:09,871
I'm going out.

565
00:55:50,571 --> 00:55:52,139
- Sir.
- Barker.

566
00:59:44,036 --> 00:59:46,439
Michael could never manage
that bit, either.

567
00:59:49,308 --> 00:59:50,511
Michael.

568
00:59:52,612 --> 00:59:54,048
My son.

569
00:59:57,717 --> 00:59:59,386
He died in the war.

570
01:00:03,322 --> 01:00:07,962
A bomb hit our house
on July the 2nd, 1942...

571
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:11,065
and killed him.

572
01:00:14,768 --> 01:00:16,404
He was 11.

573
01:00:20,708 --> 01:00:22,877
He'd be about your age
right now.

574
01:00:26,647 --> 01:00:28,947
He used to come home
from school.

575
01:00:28,949 --> 01:00:30,551
He'd have...

576
01:00:31,951 --> 01:00:34,054
He'd have ink
all over his hands.

577
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:38,492
I'd have to spend hours...

578
01:00:41,194 --> 01:00:43,263
He'd get it all over the keys.

579
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:49,103
And I don't...

580
01:00:50,103 --> 01:00:52,005
I don't think I can,
um...

581
01:00:55,609 --> 01:00:57,545
I don't know if I can,
um...

582
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,148
I don't...

583
01:01:03,884 --> 01:01:05,552
...think I can cope.

584
01:01:08,288 --> 01:01:09,657
Because...

585
01:01:11,859 --> 01:01:14,261
I should have stopped him.
I should have...

586
01:01:16,864 --> 01:01:18,532
I was his mother.

587
01:01:21,601 --> 01:01:23,436
I was his mother.

588
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:29,944
I can't...

589
01:01:32,411 --> 01:01:33,580
I can't...

590
01:01:34,748 --> 01:01:36,083
I couldn't...

591
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:38,616
- I can't bear it.
- Freda.

592
01:01:38,618 --> 01:01:40,921
I can't bear

593
01:01:42,889 --> 01:01:44,425
I can't...

594
01:01:46,627 --> 01:01:48,462
I can't bear it.

595
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:51,598
It's all right.

596
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,542
I can't.

597
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,100
Mrs. Morgan.

598
01:02:31,772 --> 01:02:34,375
I wondered if you'd like
to join me for breakfast.

599
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:38,279
Both of you.

600
01:02:41,748 --> 01:02:43,049
We would like that very much.

601
01:02:54,627 --> 01:02:57,895
I have somebody coming over
tomorrow to do my hair,

602
01:02:57,897 --> 01:03:00,367
if Freda would like
to join me.

603
01:03:02,868 --> 01:03:04,237
Freedie?

604
01:03:06,773 --> 01:03:09,409
- Thank you, Mrs. Morgan.
- Why?

605
01:03:10,743 --> 01:03:12,345
What's wrong with my hair?

606
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,480
Come in.

607
01:04:22,482 --> 01:04:25,416
<i>Herr Lubert. Frau Morgan.</i>

608
01:04:25,418 --> 01:04:27,384
Will you need me
this afternoon?

609
01:04:27,386 --> 01:04:30,457
No, thank you, Greta.
That will be all.

610
01:07:01,174 --> 01:07:02,842
These were your men.

611
01:07:07,581 --> 01:07:09,483
Do you have
the man responsible?

612
01:07:10,382 --> 01:07:11,851
I'd like to see him.

613
01:07:19,426 --> 01:07:23,864
<i>Siegfried Leitman,
former SS Sturmbannfuhrer.</i>

614
01:07:30,936 --> 01:07:32,772
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

615
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:38,976
This boy.

616
01:07:38,978 --> 01:07:40,547
Do you know him?

617
01:07:41,315 --> 01:07:42,850
- No.
- Come on.

618
01:07:46,585 --> 01:07:48,887
Come on.
You wear the same mark.

619
01:07:48,889 --> 01:07:51,422
There are many of us
with that mark.

620
01:07:51,424 --> 01:07:52,791
Then give me their names.

621
01:07:52,793 --> 01:07:54,395
Why would I do that?

622
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,632
Colonel, this man
still has his bootlaces on.

623
01:08:00,801 --> 01:08:02,400
An oversight.

624
01:08:02,402 --> 01:08:04,038
He might have hanged himself.

625
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:08,572
But you didn't, did you?
Because you're a coward.

626
01:08:08,574 --> 01:08:11,444
And you send children
to do your killing.

627
01:08:12,344 --> 01:08:15,081
Yes. They make
the best killers.

628
01:08:16,049 --> 01:08:17,815
They don't question it.

629
01:08:17,817 --> 01:08:20,217
And you don't have the stomach
for handling them.

630
01:08:20,219 --> 01:08:21,586
That's where you're wrong.

631
01:08:21,588 --> 01:08:23,921
See, I killed
younger than this.

632
01:08:23,923 --> 01:08:26,256
When the war was on, before
the bureaucrats took over,

633
01:08:26,258 --> 01:08:27,757
I killed every German
I got my hands on.

634
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,926
- Yes.
- Because I wanted it to end.

635
01:08:29,928 --> 01:08:32,162
You are murderers too.

636
01:08:32,164 --> 01:08:34,332
You think we have forgotten?

637
01:08:34,334 --> 01:08:36,667
You are like a child
who covers his eyes

638
01:08:36,669 --> 01:08:38,135
and thinks
the world goes away.

639
01:08:38,137 --> 01:08:40,005
But we won't forget.

640
01:08:40,007 --> 01:08:43,574
We will cut your men's throats
in the streets.

641
01:08:43,576 --> 01:08:45,609
We will burn your women
in their homes.

642
01:08:45,611 --> 01:08:46,711
We will bomb your children

643
01:08:46,713 --> 01:08:49,116
while they are sleeping
in their beds.

644
01:08:50,249 --> 01:08:52,248
Colonel Morgan.

645
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,053
<i>- You want it?
- Nein!</i>

646
01:08:55,722 --> 01:09:00,426
Now, give me their names.

647
01:09:35,995 --> 01:09:37,563
I'm so sorry.

648
01:09:38,432 --> 01:09:40,501
No.

649
01:09:47,539 --> 01:09:49,109
We're nearly there.

650
01:10:03,289 --> 01:10:05,122
It's still freezing.

651
01:10:05,124 --> 01:10:07,925
I actually can't feel my toes.

652
01:10:07,927 --> 01:10:10,063
Oh, that's not good.
Let me check.

653
01:10:11,697 --> 01:10:13,297
What are you doing?

654
01:10:13,299 --> 01:10:14,931
- I'm just checking.
- Stop it.

655
01:10:14,933 --> 01:10:17,135
- Stop it.
- Yep, still here.

656
01:10:17,137 --> 01:10:18,403
So are your feet.

657
01:10:18,405 --> 01:10:21,072
- Stop it.
- Ankles, yep. Calves.

658
01:10:21,074 --> 01:10:22,643
And your thighs.

659
01:10:29,415 --> 01:10:30,482
Before the war,

660
01:10:30,484 --> 01:10:32,186
I bought some land
in the Alps.

661
01:10:33,285 --> 01:10:34,721
Near Oberstdorf.

662
01:10:35,621 --> 01:10:38,989
It's not much now,
just a cabin,

663
01:10:38,991 --> 01:10:40,123
a bit like this one.

664
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:41,561
Warmer, I hope.

665
01:10:42,794 --> 01:10:44,764
I'm going to build a house.

666
01:10:46,298 --> 01:10:47,868
Something very modern.

667
01:10:49,937 --> 01:10:51,138
Just one floor...

668
01:10:52,271 --> 01:10:53,974
set into the hillside...

669
01:10:55,340 --> 01:10:57,641
with steel beams
and a glass wall

670
01:10:57,643 --> 01:10:59,713
facing the beautiful
pine trees.

671
01:11:02,348 --> 01:11:04,083
You can ski to the front door.

672
01:11:07,954 --> 01:11:09,722
What do you think?

673
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:11,925
Could you live in it?

674
01:11:14,593 --> 01:11:15,928
I don't know how to ski.

675
01:11:19,231 --> 01:11:20,998
You're smiling.

676
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,203
- I smile all the time.
- Hardly ever.

677
01:11:24,236 --> 01:11:25,806
Not since you came here.

678
01:11:27,472 --> 01:11:28,774
I like you like this.

679
01:11:33,279 --> 01:11:36,215
I never thought that I could be
happy like this again.

680
01:11:37,718 --> 01:11:39,186
Then come with us.

681
01:11:41,553 --> 01:11:44,087
You don't have your papers.

682
01:11:44,089 --> 01:11:45,258
How will you travel?

683
01:11:46,258 --> 01:11:47,694
They will clear me.

684
01:11:48,761 --> 01:11:50,731
It's just a matter of time.

685
01:12:07,146 --> 01:12:09,650
<i>This is Stunde Null.</i>

686
01:12:10,417 --> 01:12:11,985
The Zero Hour.

687
01:12:14,219 --> 01:12:15,989
Everything can start again.

688
01:13:59,092 --> 01:14:01,895
I let him get to me. Leitman.

689
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:04,761
I shouldn't have.

690
01:14:04,763 --> 01:14:07,297
- He murdered children, sir.
- Hmm.

691
01:14:07,299 --> 01:14:09,770
If it was me,
I would have loaded the gun.

692
01:14:11,937 --> 01:14:14,003
You would have loaded
the gun?

693
01:14:14,005 --> 01:14:15,073
Yeah.

694
01:14:16,209 --> 01:14:17,144
No, you wouldn't have.

695
01:14:18,377 --> 01:14:19,879
Yeah. No, I wouldn't.

696
01:14:20,946 --> 01:14:23,213
Dad always said I lack
the spine to be a soldier.

697
01:14:23,215 --> 01:14:25,483
Yes.

698
01:14:25,485 --> 01:14:28,355
Then I think your dad
probably gave you a compliment.

699
01:14:32,725 --> 01:14:35,094
It's not the war
that makes men of us.

700
01:14:39,831 --> 01:14:42,302
I've done things
I'm certainly not proud of.

701
01:14:45,672 --> 01:14:47,240
I often wonder, my wife...

702
01:14:48,106 --> 01:14:52,712
if she knew...
how she'd feel about me.

703
01:15:02,955 --> 01:15:05,756
Let's get out of this
bloody cold and go home.

704
01:15:57,276 --> 01:15:58,344
Rachael.

705
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,481
Sorry I'm late.

706
01:16:02,447 --> 01:16:03,881
Now, what's all this about?

707
01:16:03,883 --> 01:16:06,050
I need a favor.

708
01:16:06,052 --> 01:16:08,155
It's taking a long time
to clear Lubert.

709
01:16:09,355 --> 01:16:11,121
What's your secret?

710
01:16:11,123 --> 01:16:12,890
- What?
- Something's changed.

711
01:16:12,892 --> 01:16:15,458
Oh, it's my hair.
I had it done.

712
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:17,129
No. Mmm.

713
01:16:18,298 --> 01:16:19,833
Something else.

714
01:16:22,334 --> 01:16:23,536
It's Christmas.

715
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:26,138
I've always liked Christmas.

716
01:16:27,138 --> 01:16:28,275
Really?

717
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:30,576
I can't stand it.

718
01:16:31,611 --> 01:16:33,280
Not Christmas
without children.

719
01:16:38,852 --> 01:16:40,554
Oh, is the teddy bear
for the girl?

720
01:16:42,422 --> 01:16:44,290
- Yes.
- And...

721
01:16:45,624 --> 01:16:47,058
The cigars?

722
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,025
- For my husband.
- When he gets back?

723
01:16:49,027 --> 01:16:51,865
Yes. For when he gets back.

724
01:16:56,201 --> 01:16:57,868
Well, I suppose
I could ask Keith

725
01:16:57,870 --> 01:17:00,239
what's taking so long
to clear him.

726
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,828
If you're going
to spy on a girl,

727
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:00,564
the least you could do
is pay her a compliment.

728
01:18:00,566 --> 01:18:01,799
Hello, Rach.

729
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:03,634
I'm home.

730
01:18:03,636 --> 01:18:04,905
Lewis.

731
01:18:12,044 --> 01:18:13,545
Is Lubert around?

732
01:18:15,246 --> 01:18:16,712
Uh...

733
01:18:16,714 --> 01:18:18,248
I think he's in the garden.

734
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,583
- Why?
- He should join us.

735
01:18:20,585 --> 01:18:23,589
I'm going to clean up.
I have some news.

736
01:18:29,495 --> 01:18:30,597
Oh.

737
01:18:33,065 --> 01:18:35,265
What are we celebrating?

738
01:18:35,267 --> 01:18:37,337
I've been offered a new post.

739
01:18:38,905 --> 01:18:40,240
Ah.

740
01:18:41,206 --> 01:18:43,075
Your trip was successful?

741
01:18:43,875 --> 01:18:46,045
Successful? Well, um...

742
01:18:46,945 --> 01:18:48,578
Let us see, shall we?

743
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:50,715
<i>Herr Morgan?
Shall I prepare supper?</i>

744
01:18:50,717 --> 01:18:52,015
That won't
be necessary, Greta.

745
01:18:52,017 --> 01:18:54,551
We're going out to
a regimental dinner tonight.

746
01:18:54,553 --> 01:18:57,688
But you can please join us
for a glass of champagne.

747
01:18:57,690 --> 01:18:59,292
Come on. Come in and join us.

748
01:19:00,759 --> 01:19:02,091
A second Christmas.

749
01:19:02,093 --> 01:19:04,627
Shall we say a Russian one.

750
01:19:04,629 --> 01:19:06,598
A post? Where?

751
01:19:07,834 --> 01:19:09,302
The War Office.

752
01:19:09,901 --> 01:19:11,404
London.

753
01:19:12,771 --> 01:19:14,206
We're going home.

754
01:19:15,674 --> 01:19:16,676
So?

755
01:19:18,477 --> 01:19:19,643
I've been cleared.

756
01:19:19,645 --> 01:19:21,244
I knew it.

757
01:19:21,246 --> 01:19:24,116
Congratulations. Burnham
must have pulled some strings.

758
01:19:25,451 --> 01:19:27,385
- That's really wonderful.
- Yes, it is.

759
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:29,953
I, um... I don't understand.

760
01:19:29,955 --> 01:19:31,555
You haven't finished
your work here.

761
01:19:31,557 --> 01:19:33,457
Well, I put in a request.
I didn't want to tell you.

762
01:19:33,459 --> 01:19:34,791
I didn't want you
to get your hopes up.

763
01:19:34,793 --> 01:19:36,426
But we're going home.

764
01:19:36,428 --> 01:19:38,128
Hmm?

765
01:19:38,130 --> 01:19:40,764
So, from both of us,
I'd like to say thank you,

766
01:19:40,766 --> 01:19:44,170
and to new beginnings.

767
01:20:05,624 --> 01:20:07,527
Bertie?

768
01:20:11,297 --> 01:20:12,365
Bertie?

769
01:20:35,687 --> 01:20:36,688
Bertie.

770
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,355
Right.

771
01:21:12,557 --> 01:21:13,659
Sorry.

772
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,763
This dress, it isn't right.

773
01:21:27,307 --> 01:21:29,172
What are you doing?
He's downstairs.

774
01:21:29,174 --> 01:21:30,576
Just tell him.

775
01:21:32,111 --> 01:21:34,411
Tell him you're leaving
with me tonight.

776
01:21:34,413 --> 01:21:36,449
- I can't.
- Then I will.

777
01:21:43,856 --> 01:21:45,792
No, it has to come from me.

778
01:21:56,968 --> 01:21:58,737
- It's the same dress.
- What?

779
01:21:59,739 --> 01:22:00,807
Oh.

780
01:22:02,441 --> 01:22:03,676
Yes.

781
01:22:19,857 --> 01:22:21,293
My love.

782
01:22:22,962 --> 01:22:24,795
Sir.

783
01:22:34,139 --> 01:22:35,642
Rachael!

784
01:22:38,343 --> 01:22:40,579
- Lew.
- Yes?

785
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:43,747
We need to talk.

786
01:22:43,749 --> 01:22:44,884
Colonel.

787
01:22:47,652 --> 01:22:49,923
Just a minute.

788
01:22:54,861 --> 01:22:56,394
- General.
- How are you?

789
01:22:56,396 --> 01:22:57,994
Good, good.
How are you?

790
01:23:20,652 --> 01:23:23,253
You know
you'll be wasted in Whitehall.

791
01:23:23,255 --> 01:23:24,453
Well, you're leaving this city

792
01:23:24,455 --> 01:23:25,891
in better shape
than you found it.

793
01:23:26,859 --> 01:23:28,257
Cheers.

794
01:23:28,259 --> 01:23:29,596
Glad to be of service.

795
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:32,429
Sir.

796
01:23:32,431 --> 01:23:34,267
Rachael.
Oh, Rachael.

797
01:23:38,437 --> 01:23:40,270
Is it true?

798
01:23:40,272 --> 01:23:41,904
- What?
- You're really leaving?

799
01:23:41,906 --> 01:23:43,172
Won't you miss it?

800
01:23:43,174 --> 01:23:44,475
What will she miss?

801
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:46,109
- The staff?
- The people.

802
01:23:46,111 --> 01:23:47,443
Hmm.

803
01:23:47,445 --> 01:23:50,350
I must say,
I'm surprised at you, Morgan.

804
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:52,783
For what?

805
01:23:52,785 --> 01:23:55,784
I thought you'd prefer
to handle the matter yourself.

806
01:23:55,786 --> 01:23:57,954
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

807
01:23:57,956 --> 01:23:59,790
Ah, don't play innocent.

808
01:23:59,792 --> 01:24:01,993
If you're so bloody convinced
Lubert's clean,

809
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:04,761
don't send your wife
to press his case for you.

810
01:24:18,777 --> 01:24:20,443
Do you really want
to go back to London rationing?

811
01:24:20,445 --> 01:24:22,278
I'm sure
Lewis would forgive you

812
01:24:22,280 --> 01:24:23,713
if you did choose to stay.

813
01:24:23,715 --> 01:24:25,216
Susan.
Ladies. Excuse me.

814
01:24:25,218 --> 01:24:28,021
Would you mind
if I borrowed my wife?

815
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:30,689
Please.

816
01:24:45,137 --> 01:24:46,905
Tell me I'm wrong.

817
01:24:50,109 --> 01:24:51,410
What I'm thinking...

818
01:24:53,712 --> 01:24:56,011
Tell me I'm losing my mind.

819
01:24:56,013 --> 01:24:57,350
Lewis...

820
01:24:59,218 --> 01:25:01,184
I'm so sorry.

821
01:25:07,926 --> 01:25:09,495
How long?

822
01:25:11,129 --> 01:25:13,596
- No, not here.
- I was gone a few days.

823
01:25:13,598 --> 01:25:15,000
How long have you
been fucking him?

824
01:25:16,368 --> 01:25:18,201
- Don't do this.
- I want to know.

825
01:25:18,203 --> 01:25:19,603
Why? What difference
does it make?

826
01:25:19,605 --> 01:25:21,805
I want to know the moment
our marriage was over.

827
01:25:21,807 --> 01:25:24,373
It's been over for years,
ever since Michael died.

828
01:25:24,375 --> 01:25:27,211
Don't you dare
bring him into this.

829
01:25:27,213 --> 01:25:29,445
Everything changed
when he died.

830
01:25:29,447 --> 01:25:30,749
Why can't you admit it?

831
01:25:33,852 --> 01:25:34,986
You left me.

832
01:25:39,325 --> 01:25:41,291
- It's my fault.
- No, no.

833
01:25:41,293 --> 01:25:42,795
It's mine.

834
01:25:45,097 --> 01:25:46,632
Why can't you just say it?

835
01:25:47,766 --> 01:25:49,000
Say it.

836
01:25:50,768 --> 01:25:53,772
You blame me
for letting him die.

837
01:26:10,889 --> 01:26:12,023
Take me home.

838
01:26:12,825 --> 01:26:14,160
Please, can you take me home?

839
01:26:18,496 --> 01:26:21,633
Just get in. Get in the car.
Get in the car.

840
01:26:22,401 --> 01:26:24,001
Give me the keys.

841
01:26:24,003 --> 01:26:26,105
- Give me the keys.
- Here they are, sir.

842
01:27:03,475 --> 01:27:05,275
Rachael, get down.

843
01:27:05,277 --> 01:27:06,678
Rachael, hold on.

844
01:27:10,281 --> 01:27:12,416
- Oh, dear God.
- Rachael, are you hurt?

845
01:27:12,418 --> 01:27:13,582
- Are you hurt?
- Lewis.

846
01:27:13,584 --> 01:27:14,818
I'm going after him.

847
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,686
- Lewis, Lewis.
- It was two shots.

848
01:27:16,688 --> 01:27:18,490
- Stay in the car.
- Just...

849
01:27:27,298 --> 01:27:28,900
Hey!

850
01:27:36,008 --> 01:27:38,207
I will fire! Stop!

851
01:27:43,315 --> 01:27:44,484
Bertie?

852
01:27:55,593 --> 01:27:58,196
Stop or I will fire!
I will shoot!

853
01:27:59,664 --> 01:28:01,501
You have nowhere to go!

854
01:28:27,459 --> 01:28:28,859
Albert!

855
01:28:30,027 --> 01:28:31,263
Freda, no.

856
01:28:33,264 --> 01:28:34,931
It's too late.

857
01:28:34,933 --> 01:28:36,632
Albert!

858
01:28:36,634 --> 01:28:38,835
Help me! Help me!

859
01:28:38,837 --> 01:28:40,705
Albert!

860
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:48,781
Come on.

861
01:28:57,556 --> 01:29:00,660
Just stay with me.
Stay with me.

862
01:29:20,646 --> 01:29:22,181
Take him.

863
01:29:58,316 --> 01:30:00,684
Papa!

864
01:30:10,829 --> 01:30:12,964
I should never
have brought you here.

865
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,408
Can't blame you...

866
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:27,380
for wanting to start again.

867
01:31:01,045 --> 01:31:02,280
Huh?

868
01:32:15,453 --> 01:32:16,422
Lewis?

869
01:32:19,857 --> 01:32:21,259
Are you all right?

870
01:32:23,795 --> 01:32:25,162
How is she?

871
01:32:25,164 --> 01:32:26,465
She's sleeping.

872
01:32:31,436 --> 01:32:32,938
He knows.

873
01:32:37,642 --> 01:32:38,944
Good.

874
01:32:40,044 --> 01:32:41,547
We should leave
in the morning.

875
01:33:54,384 --> 01:33:55,553
Just go.

876
01:34:49,874 --> 01:34:51,243
How did it happen?

877
01:34:54,346 --> 01:34:55,313
Was he in pain?

878
01:34:59,249 --> 01:35:00,985
He was caught in the blast.

879
01:35:02,353 --> 01:35:03,388
It was instant.

880
01:35:09,893 --> 01:35:11,262
Yeah.

881
01:35:29,380 --> 01:35:31,683
You know,
I never wanted to leave you.

882
01:35:36,553 --> 01:35:37,588
I had to.

883
01:35:41,892 --> 01:35:43,594
You know, I see his face...

884
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,732
every time I look at you.

885
01:35:48,999 --> 01:35:50,636
When you laugh, I...

886
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:56,905
h- h-hear his voice.

887
01:35:56,907 --> 01:35:58,142
I...

888
01:35:59,611 --> 01:36:00,743
When I...

889
01:36:00,745 --> 01:36:02,548
Every time I touch you, I...

890
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:12,124
I smell him on your skin.

891
01:36:33,945 --> 01:36:35,713
You're the best part
of me, Rachael.

892
01:36:38,115 --> 01:36:40,018
You always will be.

893
01:39:05,963 --> 01:39:07,331
Rachael?

894
01:39:09,066 --> 01:39:10,702
Ready?

895
01:39:36,660 --> 01:39:37,628
Rachael?

896
01:39:42,333 --> 01:39:44,000
No, no, no, no, no.

897
01:39:44,002 --> 01:39:45,969
You're coming
with me.

898
01:39:45,971 --> 01:39:47,973
I need you.

899
01:39:49,039 --> 01:39:50,609
We needed each other.

900
01:39:53,311 --> 01:39:56,248
But this is, this is
what you wanted.

901
01:39:57,715 --> 01:39:58,917
To start again.

902
01:40:00,918 --> 01:40:02,221
I do.

903
01:40:04,155 --> 01:40:05,490
I do.

904
01:40:13,598 --> 01:40:14,732
Forgive me.

905
01:40:20,036 --> 01:40:21,706
Rachael.

906
01:40:31,715 --> 01:40:32,851
Papa!

907
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:36,588
Papa!
